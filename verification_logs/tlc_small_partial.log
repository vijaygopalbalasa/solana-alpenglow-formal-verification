Result: INTERRUPTED after ~3 minutes
- 42,665,962 states generated
- 6,084,726 distinct states explored
- NO INVARIANT VIOLATIONS FOUND
- State space not fully explored (67,101 states still on queue)

NOTE: TLC found no violations in over 6 million states. Full model checking would require longer runtime.
